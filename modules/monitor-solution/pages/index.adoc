Select a date range at the top to limit results to a certain time.

You can also search by keyword across all three columns.
In the example screenshot shown previously, the search was filtered by the term "controller" to only show actions performed by the system controller.

== Cluster Activity Log

Each cluster also has an activity log, where you can view actions specific to that cluster.

=== Navigate to My Clusters

First find a cluster in the cluster list that you want to monitor.

Click on the Access Management button.
