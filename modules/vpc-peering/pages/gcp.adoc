= Set up VPC Peering on GCP
:description: The steps to set up VPC peering between TigerGraph's GCP VPC and your GCP VPC.
:sectnums:
:experimental:

This is a guide for setting up a VPC peering connection between your
TigerGraph Cloud VPC and another GCP VPC.

== Prerequisite

* At least one unterminated TigerGraph Cloud cluster on GCP

== Procedure

[[initiate-vpc-peering]]
=== Initiate VPC Peering

Log in to the Cloud portal and navigate to the Network tab, click
btn:[Initiate VPC Peering]

In the TigerGraph VPC section, choose the TigerGraph VPC that you want
to initiate the peering connection from.

In the Peered VPC section, fill in the information of the VPC that you
hope to peer with:

* VPC ID: `+projects/[projectID]/global/networks/[VPCName]+`, where
`+projectID+` is the ID of your GCP project, and `+VPCName+` is the name
of the VPC.

=== Create VPC peering connection from peered VPC to host VPC

After completing Step 1, your TigerGraph VPC will create a peering
configuration to the VPC you hope to peer with. At this time, the
peering connection will appear as *Inactive*. To complete the peering
connection, your still need to create a matching peering configuration
on your peered VPC to the TigerGraph VPC:

. In the Google Cloud Console, go to the btn:[VPC Network Peering] page.
https://console.cloud.google.com/networking/peering/list[Go to VPC
Network Peering]
. Click btn:[Create connection].
. Click btn:[Continue].
. Enter a *Name* for your peering connection.
. Under btn:[Your VPC network], select a network you want to peer.
. Select the TigerGraph network as the network to peer with.
* Select btn:[In another project]. You will need to specify the project ID
that includes the network you want to peer with and the name of the VPC
network:
** Project ID:`+tgcloud-prod+`
** VPC network name: Name of your TigerGraph Cloud VPC. You can find it
in the menu:TigerGraph Cloud portal[Network tab > VPC Peering] page.
Choose `+GCP+` as the platform, and in the VPC column is the VPC name.
. You can leave the other fields as they are (with only btn:[Export subnet
routes with public IP] selected) unless you need special configurations.
. Click btn:[Create].

After creating the matching peering configuration, the status of your VPC connection should change to btn:[Active] meaning the two VPCs are peered successfully.
