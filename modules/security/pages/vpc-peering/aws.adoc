:description: The steps to set up VPC peering between TigerGraph's AWS VPC and your AWS VPC.
:page-aliases: vpc-peering/aws.adoc


This is a guide for setting up a VPC peering connection between your
TigerGraph Cloud VPC and another AWS VPC.

== Prerequisites

* Unterminated TigerGraph Cloud clusters on AWS

== Procedure

[[initiate-vpc-peering]]
=== Initiate VPC peering

Log into the cloud portal, and navigate to the Network tab. Click
Initiate VPC peering.

In the TigerGraph VPC section, choose the TigerGraph VPC that you want
to initiate the peering connection from.

In the Peered VPC section, fill in the information of the VPC that you
hope to peer with:

* `+OwnerID+`
** The ID of the VPC ownerâ€™s AWS account, ex: `+123456789012+`
* `+Region+`
** The region of the VPC you want to peer with, ex: `+us-west-1+`
* `+VPC ID+`
** The ID of the VPC: `+vpc-123456789abcdef01+`
* `+CIDR+`
** CIDR-block of the peered VPC, ex: `+10.0.0.0/16+`. You can also use a
IPv6 CIDR here if your peered VPC has one.

[[accept-vpc-peering-request]]
=== Accept VPC peering request

After you have completed the first step, a VPC peering connection will
be sent to your VPC. Follow the steps below to accept the peering
connection on your AWS VPC. See more in AWS's documentation on
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/create-vpc-peering-connection.html#accept-vpc-peering-connection[Accepting
VPC Peering Connections].

[arabic]
. Go to menu:VPC service[Peering Connections] in the AWS web console
. Accept the connection from the TigerGraph VPC

[[update-route-table-for-vpc-peering-connection]]
=== Update route table for VPC peering connection

After accepting the peering request, you still need to update your route
table for the peering connection.

To add a route for a VPC peering connection:

[arabic]
. Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.
. In the navigation pane, choose btn:[Route Tables].
. Select the checkbox next to the route table that's associated with
the subnet in which your instance resides.
. Choose menu:Actions[Edit routes].
. Choose btn:[Add route].
. For *Destination*, enter the CIDR block of the TigerGraph VPC you are
peering with. You can find the CIDR block of the TigerGraph VPC at
btn:[Peering Connections] in the VPC service where you accepted the peering
connection. There is a column "*Requester CIDRs*"*.*
. For *Target*, select the VPC peering connection, and then choose *Save
changes*.
