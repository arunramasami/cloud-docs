= Manage Database Users
:experimental:

When you connect to a TigerGraph Cloud instance programmatically, such as from connectors like pyTigerGraph or the remote GSQL client, you often need to provide credentials that are created in the database of your solution.
This is different from your TigerGraph Organization account which allows you to log in to solutions in your organization to which you have access.

NOTE: You can only create database users for solutions created after August 18th, 2022.

== Create a database user

=== Prerequisite
* Your TigerGraph Cloud cloud has role Organization Admin

=== Procedure

. From the Cloud portal, go to btn:[Solutions].
. Find the solution you want to create users for, and select btn:[Access Management].
. From the Solution Access Management page, click btn:[Database Access].
. Click btn:[Add new users] and specify the username and password.
* Make sure to keep a record of the username and password when you create the user.
The password is no longer visible once you leave the page.
. Assign roles to the user as needed.
For details on TigerGraph's role-based access control model, see xref:tigergraph-server:user-access:access-control-model.adoc#_role_based_access_control[Access Control Model].
