= Cloud Providers and Regions

TigerGraph Cloud offers three cloud platform options: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
The choice of cloud providers and regions affects the pricing and network latency of your clusters.
The region indicates the physical location of your cluster.

Each cloud provider has different offerings for instance type, disk storage, and backup storage.
TigerGraph Cloud supports free-tier clusters on AWS and GCP.
You may choose to deploy free-tier clusters on any region in AWS or GCP.
