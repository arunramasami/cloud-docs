This list can be found under Clusters on the left side menu or on the main page. If you know that your organization account has running clusters but you are unable to see them, check to see that your account has the correct xref:security:manage-org-users.adoc[user access privileges].

== Stop a cluster

When you stop a cluster, you shut down the virtual machine instance.
The TigerGraph database is frozen in its current state.
Billing for that machine instance also stops.
Scheduled backups also stop, but the backup copies are kept in EFS on AWS, Azure Files on Azure, and GCP Filestore on GCP.

You will still incur charges for disk storage and backups when a cluster is stopped.

== Restart a cluster

You can restart a stopped cluster at any time. After a warm-up period, the cluster will return to the state it was in when it was stopped.

== Terminate a cluster

By terminating a cluster, you deprovision the virtual machine and the attached disk storage. The cluster, as well as everything in the attached disk storage, is deleted according to the cloud platform's policies and cannot be recovered.


=== Archive a cluster

After a cluster has been terminated, it can be archived so that it no longer shows up on the default view in the list of clusters.

To archive a cluster, click on the cluster row in My Clusters to expand it and click the *Archived* toggle.
