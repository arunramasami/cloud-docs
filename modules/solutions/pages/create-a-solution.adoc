= Create a Cluster
:page-aliases: create.adoc
:experimental:

TigerGraph Cloud clusters offer a full-scale analytics platform to store and query your graph data.

This page guides you through the process of creating a *free-tier* cluster (subject to xref:reference:service-limits.adoc[limits]).

[CAUTION]
====
Free-tier clusters are for training, learning, and small-scale proof of concept use cases. Free-tier clusters do not support backup and restore.

For more advanced testing and learning, consider adding a payment method and using paid-tier clusters to access the backup and restore feature.

== Create a Cluster

On the Clusters page, if you have no clusters and have the privileges to create a cluster in your organization, you will see an option in the center to create a cluster.

=== Choose a name and version

image::cluster-name-and-version.png[]

Not all TigerGraph versions that are offered on-premises are offered on TigerGraph Cloud.
In the dropdown list, choose the version of TigerGraph you want to run.

Name your cluster to set it apart from others in your cluster view.
You can also optionally give it a description to explain what you plan to use it for.

=== Select cloud provider and region

image:cloud-provider-and-region.png[]

TigerGraph Cloud supports free-tier clusters on all three cloud providers.
Different providers have different regions available.

Select your preferred cloud provider and the region closest to you for the best performance.

Check out the Reference page for each cloud provider to get a full list of regions and cluster hardware available:

* xref:reference:aws.adoc[]
* xref:reference:azure.adoc[]
* xref:reference:gcp.adoc[]


[NOTE]
The xref:tigergraph-server:gsql-shell:web.adoc[GSQL Web Shell] is currently not supported on Azure-hosted clusters due to a limitation with Azure Application Gateway.

=== Instance settings

Select TG.Free to create a free-tier cluster for the purposes of this guide.
More powerful virtual machines require you to use credits in your account or connect a payment method.

Select *50 GB* for your disk size to stay within the free tier.

On the free tier, partition and replication are limited to 1, meaning xref:tigergraph-server:ha:index.adoc[high availability (HA)] is disabled.


=== Advanced settings

image::advanced-settings-top.png[]

If you have set up a paid cluster, you can set up private access as long as your region supports it.

See xref:private-access:index.adoc[] for details.

In this section, you can also add a custom subdomain to easily identify your cluster via URL.
If you don't add a custom subdomain, a random alphanumeric subdomain will be automatically generated.

=== Choose a starter kit

image:starter-kit-list.png[]

TigerGraph Cloud Starter Kits are built with a sample graph data schema, dataset, and queries focused on a specific use case to help you get started quickly.
Most of our starter kits have a link:https://www.tigergraph.com/starterkits/[demo video] that walks you through the schema and the queries built for its use case.

Select a starter kit or select btn:[Blank] to create an empty cluster that you can load with your own schema and data using GraphStudio.

==== Graph Machine Learning Starter Kit

image::advanced-settings-mlwb.png[]

TigerGraph Cloud supports integration with xref:ml-workbench:intro:index.adoc[Machine Learning Workbench] and also provides a custom-built starter kit.
Machine Learning Workbench is not available on other starter kits or on TigerGraph Cloud solutions older than version 3.8.0.

[NOTE]

Machine Learning Workbench is only available on single-machine clusters.

=== Create cluster

When you've finished making your choices, click btn:[Create Cluster] at the bottom of the screen to begin the creation process.
It usually takes several minutes to make a cluster available.

== Access your cluster

After you have created your cluster, it may take a few minutes for it to be ready.
Once you see the status of your cluster turn to "Ready", you can choose many ways to access your cluster.

See xref:access-solution:cluster-access.adoc[] for more information.
