= Access a Cluster through GSQL Web Shell

[NOTE]
====
The GSQL Web Shell is temporarily disabled for new clusters due to recent networking improvements on the TigerGraph Cloud backend.
Please use the xref:tigergraph-server:gsql-shell:using-a-remote-gsql-client.adoc[Remote GSQL client] to access GSQL on new TigerGraph Cloud clusters until access is restored.
Clusters created before June 20, 2022 are unaffected and still have access to the Web Shell.
====

With a paid tier cluster and a valid payment method, you can also access the cluster through the GSQL Web Shell. The web shell allows you to run GSQL commands on your TigerGraph Cloud cluster.

== Open GSQL Web Shell

=== 1. Navigate to My Clusters

After https://tgcloud.io/[logging into TigerGraph Cloud], go to *My Clusters*.
